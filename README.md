# schedule
A basic PHP script that creates a study schedule based on an API.

The script has been kept extremely simple by design.

## Command-line installation
As an alternative to downloading the files manually from GitHub, you can use the command-line.

In the desired directory, type the following: `git clone https://github.com/reclaimingmytime/schedule.git`

## Configuration
1. Copy `config.default.php` to `config.php`.
2. Open `config.php` and change the required variables.

## Command-line updates
As an alternative to downloading the new files manually, if you have installed the script through git, you can simply update your local repository using `git pull` in that directory.

Note that your configuration file `config.php` will be **kept** in any case, as that file is ignored by git.
